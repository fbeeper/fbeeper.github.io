Hello! Happy to meet you! This is Ferran Poveda (@fbeeper). 

I...
* Am a human being (I think?!)
* Grew up near Barcelona, but now I'm living in Los Angeles.
* Speak Catalan, Spanish, and English (with a fun accent.)
* Earned a PhD in Comuter Science at my *alma mater* Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona.
* Build apps like [MyPlate Calorie Counter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myplate-calorie-counter/id502317923), but can't stop at coding and splash into product and design as much as I can.
* Am an amateur computer history and beer cap collector.
* Also am a terrible squash player, can do wheelies with a bicicle, and know how to ride a snakeboard/pivotboard.
