Hello! 

This is Ferran Poveda (@fbeeper). Earthling from Barcelona, currently living in Los Angeles and iOS @ [MyPlate Calorie Counter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myplate-calorie-counter/id502317923). 

I'm a victim of my omnivorous curiosity. This site is about some of my favorite things: iOS development, product, design, accessibility, computer history, beer, and perhaps even biking or snakeboarding.
