This site runs only on HTML and CSS. No scripts. No cookies. Just staticly generated content.

I'm **not collecting personal information from visitors**. But there is some level of analytics. I want to know what interests people out there. For this reason, I still consider it fair to let you know how it works: I'm using the JavaScript-free image-based tracking of [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com). This is not gathering any personally identifiable info, and you can get more details [here](https://www.goatcounter.com/gdpr).

One last thing: Technically, there is some *javascript*, but it is not an actual script. It is just data in the form of [JSON-LD for linked data](https://json-ld.org).

For any questions or concerns. Ping me @fbeeper.
