For the longest time, I've felt that once something is published on the Internet, it is there to stay. 

Just looking at the Internet Archive, this is probably true. However, today's rumination is that we aren't chained to keep our active content static. We can understand our social media, sites, and blogs more like Wikis and feel free (even encouraged) to evolve it.

Whether if I learned something that will make it better, found new angles to the same stories, refined my style, changed my mind... I will change it.
